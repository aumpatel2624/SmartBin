## SmartBin: Waste Classification System

This project implements a smart bin prototype that utilizes image classification to categorize waste items as dry, wet, recyclable, or non-recyclable.

**Components:**

* Arduino Nano microcontroller
* OV7670 camera module
* LED display
* (Optional) MicroSD card module for data storage

**Software:**

* Arduino IDE
* Machine learning model for image classification (potentially a pre-trained CNN)
* (Optional) Libraries for image processing and model integration with Arduino

**Project Functionality:**

1. Upon activation (e.g., lid opening), the OV7670 camera captures an image of the discarded item.
2. (Optional) Pre-processing techniques (resizing, color adjustments) are applied to the captured image for efficient model inference.
3. The pre-trained machine learning model analyzes the image and classifies the waste item as dry, wet, recyclable, or non-recyclable.
4. The classification result is displayed on the LED screen (e.g., "Dry", "Wet", "Recycle", "Non-Recycle").
5. (Optional) Captured images and classification results can be stored on a microSD card for further analysis or model retraining.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Hardware Setup:**
    * Install the OV7670 camera module and LED display onto the Arduino Nano following the respective connection guides.
    * (Optional) If using a microSD card module, connect it following the manufacturer's instructions.
2. **Software Setup:**
    * Install the Arduino IDE ([https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/360019833020-Download-and-install-Arduino-IDE](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/360019833020-Download-and-install-Arduino-IDE)).
    * Download the necessary libraries for image processing and the chosen machine learning model (refer to specific model documentation).
    * Upload the provided Arduino sketch (**.ino file**) to your Arduino Nano.
3. **Model Configuration:**
    * Integrate the pre-trained machine learning model into the Arduino sketch following the chosen model's documentation.
    * (Optional) If training a custom model, ensure the training data and model files are accessible to the Arduino sketch.

**Notes:**

* This readme provides a general overview. Specific libraries, code modifications, and model integration steps will depend on the chosen model and hardware configuration.
* Ensure the machine learning model is compatible with the processing power and memory limitations of the Arduino Nano.
* Train or acquire a model with a diverse dataset of waste images for improved classification accuracy.

**Further Development:**

* Implement data logging to store images and classification results on a microSD card for data analysis and model retraining.
* Integrate a buzzer or notification system to alert users about bin status or sorting mistakes.
* Design a mobile application to interact with the smart bin, displaying real-time classification data and bin fullness status.

This project serves as a foundational framework for a smart waste classification system. Explore the functionalities mentioned in "Further Development" to enhance its capabilities!
